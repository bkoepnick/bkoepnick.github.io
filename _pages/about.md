I'm a biochemistry Ph.D. student at the University of Washington, where I research protein design with [David Baker](https://bakerlab.org). My primary work is with [Foldit](https://fold.it), a free online computer game that we use to crowdsource problems in protein modeling and design. I develop protein design tools for Foldit and set up design challenges for Foldit players, then I analyze Foldit players' solutions and test their protein designs in the lab. 

For more details, see my [Research](/research/) page. Or, check my [Blog posts](/blog/) for the latest news from Foldit!
