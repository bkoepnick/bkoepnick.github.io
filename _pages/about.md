I'm a research scientist at the [Institute for Protein Design](https://www.ipd.uw.edu/), at the University of Washington in Seattle. My primary work is with [Foldit](https://fold.it), a free online computer game that we use to crowdsource protein modeling and design. I develop software tools for Foldit and set up protein design challenges for Foldit players, then I analyze Foldit players' designs and test the proteins in the lab.
